        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the concept that everyones brains are malleable to be reshaped by neural networks through practice and learning. This means like a muscle our brains can be worked out to change them, neuroplasticity is what allows us to learn new information. Although neuroplasticity is more dominant in early development, our brains are constantly evolving in adulthood as well.

            The idea that the brain is not fixed even as an adult is an important concept for me. I’ve started studying this web development course after years of not studying and came in with a lot of doubt whether or not I would have the capacity to learn everything that I was going to need to. Knowing this I now feel that if I train hard and long enough I can rewire my brain to become a coding fanatic. Reading up on neuroplasticity I found that getting sufficient sleep and exercising can both help with increasing plasticity. These are two things that I have included into my learning plan so that I have a healthy lifestyle while I am taking on all this knowledge.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset is the concept that when someone believes that their intelligence can grow through learning they tend to have better learning outcomes. It is very closely related to neuroplasticity as we know that the brain can be reshaped through learning forming neural pathways even in adulthood. A growth mindset is exactly that, a mindset. If we have a growth mindset we feel that what we are learning is up to the work we are putting in which will result in the outcome. If we have a fixed mindset we feel that no matter the work we put in our innate brain is either ‘good’ or ‘not good’ enough to take in the learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel this is an important concept for students as there are many times when studying something difficult such as web development where you encounter difficult problems. With the understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset a student will better handle these challenges. Keep learning, keep going back to a problem and looking at different ways to solve it. Our brains are  constantly changing with the learning so although it may feel at times you don't have the skills and knowledge to solve a problem. If you keep trying to build the knowledge and trust you can learn a topic you will have a much better learning outcome.
