        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          One thing I have thought about is how my ego can be a big contributor to my learning. I think I am quick to think I am no good at this or if it's going well I am really good at this depending on the task at hand. I have found doing the core learning in foundations very useful to reflect on my learning and see it as something that is very much in my hands if I put in the work I'll get there. I also have found that I do not like to be behind in learning from classmates. THis makes me worry I am going through the course material too slowly. I think the core material has helped me recognise this and try spend my time on getting the most out of the learning for myself and worry less about were I am at compared to others.

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Programming is all about problem solving. Which can be very difficult at times. I think the values and self awareness we bring to programming are going to be a huge contributor to how we deal with difficult problems. If I know the reasons I am wanting to learn this difficult skill I am going to be far more resilient to obstacles. Programming is also an industry that deals with a huge amount of other people. Having empathy and understanding to the difficulty that your fellow peers may be having will create a better community of support for everyone. Not only this but programming the web is creating platforms for everyone. If I have a better understanding of myself, I will know what I’m bringing to a project. With this it is important to know any blindspots you have as we don’t want a web that is exclusive to other people's values.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about this core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>Just how useful it has been to think about these core principles while I have been doing this tech study. I would have initially thought that these things are two very different subjects that are not intertwined. I now see how useful it is to think about my perspective and worldview while I am going down this web developer pathway. I don’t only want to be a good developer but I also want to be someone that is a good work colleague and a good communicator. Tech is only part of a web developer's job and so I think it has been hugely important to think about the other reasons I want to get into this work and my values with this.

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I probably found the loop speaking the  hardest challenge. I am pretty slow to be comfortable speaking openly with new people. This is something I would like to improve onn so enjoyed the challenge.

        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          I think these skills of developing your EQ are hugely beneficial in the industry. Having students that can not only learn all the tech skills but also are good communicators and people prospective workplaces want in their team.

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          No. I think I would have for one been overloaded with tech content in the first few weeks if that was all we were doing. As well as this I found thinking about my learning really helpful. I have studied lots before and never had so much time thinking about my learning process and introspection on why I was currently studying. I think this has helped me be very motivated during the foundation course.
