        <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
        <p>
            I was starting off on the built-in-methods section of the Kata’s and the first problem was to use a function to take an array of strings and use the join method to join them together and return a complete word. I think this got my confidence up a little too high as I googled the method and was able to get the desired result. So I quickly moved on to the next question of using the map function to capitalize the first word of every letter, again I quickly started googling MDN web docs. I found .map to apply a function to every element in an array. I then found .split to create an array from a string and the .charAt and .toUpperCase methods to apply the upper case lettering to the first character in the element. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was looking kinda good at this point. I had almost everything I needed to create a capitalize function that could do the job. Well I started to write the code using these methods and got myself all muddled. I got console.logging and none of my outcomes were what I was expecting. I went back to various google searches and found a ton of information on methods I didn’t need to use. I was getting pretty frustrated at points. I took some time away from the computer and came back with a plan to go through my code step by step.

            I never wrote any pseudocode to begin with and so when I started writing this the order of the methods I needed to use became obvious. First I would turn my array into a string .split(‘ ‘) then I would take my array and apply a method to every element in the array .map() which would return the charAT(0).toUpperCase() and lastly I would join(‘ ‘) up the arrays back into a string. I entered this and still wasn't quite right. With a console.log I was able to identify that I needed to rejoin the rest of the characters with .substr(1).  Making a plan before diving into google searches and writing code was a key missed step for me here. You don’t want to be in a position where you have written a function with a bunch of methods that you don't know what should be the result step by step. I now try to make a pseudocode plan before every problem.

        <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
        <p>
            I was pretty happy with how I solved the FizzBuzz challenge in the Sprint 4 Javascript Kata. Unlike the problem above where I got myself blocked by racing into a problem before making a plan on how to solve the problem. I took my time and spent about 20 minutes writing the pseudocode I thought I would need to solve this problem.  I then went through step by step and wrote the code googling any operators or statements I needed for that line of pseudocode. Checking off the line of pseudocode as I went. The result was just as expected and I felt amazing. See pseudocode below, note: spoiler if you haven't done the fizz buzz challenge yet.
