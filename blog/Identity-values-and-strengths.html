        <h3>Core Personal Values </h3>
        <p>My main personal values stem around my relationships with my family and friends. I think family and friends are the most important part of my life so looking after these relationships is key to me. My key values I would think would be similar to most people: being kind to others. Which includes empathy for others, not knowing what others have on in their lives and being kind in the face of your own problems.  I  value doing what I enjoy, for me that's having some creativity with work and having fun with friends. With this I also value hard work and commitment as we can’t have fun all the time and hard work is what provides for your whanau.

          I am a born and bred kiwi so I think our culture is very much about taking care of those around you looking out for one another. My parents have always stressed that family is very important and so having good communication with family and treating everyone well has come with that.  
        </p>

          I can’t think of a specific situation where I had an ethical decision but there have been many times in my life dealing with personal relationships where someone has been upset. I think in these situations it is important to keep an open mind and have clear communication. Everyone has different views and opinions and so the best way to learn is to hear someone else's point of view.

          My key strengths on my learning journey are that I am very committed when I focus myself to a task. I think I do not give up easily and can work with a good amount of pressure on my shoulders. I think this is also my limitation as I sometimes will try and learn everything in great detail that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Knowing when to let a task go and move on to the next one is something I will need to improve on. I think I work well with others as I am happy to take on and give feedback to the best of my ability.

          From experience I have worked with people in a work environment who do not put in as much work as other team members. This is always a frustrating scenario as you want to be providing equal effort if you are all working together. I have found it best to keep communicating in these scenarios to make sure the people lagging behind know they are not putting in the work or it may just be that they don’t understand what they need to be doing. I find communicating and keeping an open mind works better than getting frustrated as people may not know what they need to be doing if they are never told.
