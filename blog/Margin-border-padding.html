        <p>Margin is the space around an element’s border, padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. The margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.

        <p>I like to picture these in the resemblance of someone's house and property. Some people have bigger houses while other people have smaller houses. Some people have bigger properties around which their house and their fence sits. Think of the fence as the border. A fence can be narrow or broader. Within the fence if padding were made bigger they would have a bigger house. Outside the fence if margin were made bigger they would have more property in which the house (content) land (padding) and fence (border) all sit.

        <p>In this sense making the margin bigger will push away your neighbour. If everyone has big properties outside their fence there would be a lot of land without houses on. Exactly as if we put multiple margins on nearby elements, we see the margins create whitespace between them, giving them lots of room
