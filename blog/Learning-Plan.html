        <h3>Goals for the programme</h3>
        <p>I am excited to start my learning with dev academy! My long term plan with studying with dev academy is to gain a job as a junior web developer and build my career from there. I like working as part of a team so I could see myself gaining skills in various web developer roles and ideally become a senior web developer one day.

        <h3>Strengths & Limitations</h3>
        <p>I think my strengths with learning are when I dive into study I am very committed and will put the time and energy into learning everything in as much detail as possible. I am quite open to feedback as I know this is a great resource for learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations are that sometimes I get bogged down with minor details and dont keep the broad picture in mind which can result in a lot of time being wasted when it could be used for better things.

        <h3>Skill improvement</h3>
        <p>I would like to improve my public speaking skills! I definitely find it hard to speak up in groups especially when talking about myself or my own work. I think this would help a lot with going into an office environment.

        <h3>Workload & Help</h3>
        <p>I plan to manage my workload by staying on time with the allocated time given for assignments. For me this works best by getting stuck in to work in the morning and still leaving time in the evening for some exercise and relaxation to clear the head. I have always found that doing some exercise is my favourite way to destress.  
        </p>
        <p>I will seek help from my peers and facilitators when needed. I also find some of my best learning is when I am able to solve a problem on my own. As I said earlier I do have a tendency to try to solve a problem on my own for too long of a period.  Hence, a good goal for me would be to communicate with peers earlier.

        <h3>Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>A supportive feedback rich environment. I would like to know where I should be spending my time on tasks, and what I should be focusing on. If I am doing something well I would love to know as this provides me with lots of confidence. If I am not quite doing something as well as I should be I would also love to know as constructive feedback will motivate me to improve in areas I need to!

        <h3>Scheduling</h3>
        <p>I have a few work related meetings and am doing one night shift a week if I can manage it. I should always be contactable and will mostly be working on course material during office hours.

      <article class="LP-article">
        <h3>Goals for the programme</h3>
        <p>I don't think I have a long term career pathway that I can say this will be what I do. The main thing I would like to get out of Dev academy in the medium term is learning the tech skills so that I can be hired into an entry level web developer role and from there I would like to be able to build on these skills so that my options are open.

        <h3>Strengths & Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          I still think my strengths and limitations are what I said for foundations. I found in bootcamp I was also moving through the content quite fast when I did understand a concept. I think I’m not someone who takes a lot of time to sit back and reflect so this is something that I can improve upon in bootcamp.

        <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          I think my biggest non technical challenge will be to stay positive with myself when things get difficult. I have noticed with the foundations programme I am pretty tough on myself If I don’t understand what I need to do. I think the core learning that we have done on a growth mindset has been hugely beneficial for me. Knowing that I will get there and trying different learning approaches will be key.

        <h3>Skill improvement</h3>
        <p>
          As I said in my foundation's skill improvement I would like to improve my public speaking skills in groups. Expanding on this I would like to become better generally talking about tech related problems with my peers. I think sometimes I worry that i’m at a different understanding level so I don't speak up. To be able to talk clearly on tech projects with my peers is something I would like to improve.

        <h3>Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p>
          I think it is similar to my expectations to foundations in that I would like a lot of feedback so I know where I am at. I don’t want too much given to me as I think the best learning I've noticed from foundations is going away and learning what I need to online. I would like as much constructive feedback as possible so If I do some code that works I can then refine it.

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          My main expectation of myself is that I work on material for at least 8 hours a day. I feel with this learning that if I put the time and work in I will be able to succeed in the development I want to get out of myself. With this I also want to make sure I keep a healthy lifestyle and do a couple hours a day for me. I know this helps my learning if I keep some routine to my day. I want to take on feedback and be very reflective of my learning patterns. I think sometimes I race forward in tasks but It is just as helpful to take some reflective time to see where I should be focusing my time.
