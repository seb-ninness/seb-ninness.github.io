        <h3>Goals for the programme</h3>
        <p>I am excited to start my learning with dev academy! My long term plan with studying with dev academy is to gain a job as a junior web developer and build my career from there. I like working as part of a team so I could see myself gaining skills in various web developer roles and ideally become a senior web developer one day.

        <h3>Strengths & Limitations</h3>
        <p>I think my strengths with learning are when I dive into study I am very committed and will put the time and energy into learning everything in as much detail as possible. I am quite open to feedback as I know this is a great resource for learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations are that sometimes I get bogged down with minor details and dont keep the broad picture in mind which can result in a lot of time being wasted when it could be used for better things.

        <h3>Skill improvement</h3>
        <p>I would like to improve my public speaking skills! I definitely find it hard to speak up in groups especially when talking about myself or my own work. I think this would help a lot with going into an office environment.

        <h3>Workload & Help</h3>
        <p>I plan to manage my workload by staying on time with the allocated time given for assignments. For me this works best by getting stuck in to work in the morning and still leaving time in the evening for some exercise and relaxation to clear the head. I have always found that doing some exercise is my favourite way to destress.  
        </p>
        <p>I will seek help from my peers and facilitators when needed. I also find some of my best learning is when I am able to solve a problem on my own. As I said earlier I do have a tendency to try to solve a problem on my own for too long of a period.  Hence, a good goal for me would be to communicate with peers earlier.

        <h3>Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>A supportive feedback rich environment. I would like to know where I should be spending my time on tasks, and what I should be focusing on. If I am doing something well I would love to know as this provides me with lots of confidence. If I am not quite doing something as well as I should be I would also love to know as constructive feedback will motivate me to improve in areas I need to!

        <h3>Scheduling</h3>
        <p>I have a few work related meetings and am doing one night shift a week if I can manage it. I should always be contactable and will mostly be working on course material during office hours.
