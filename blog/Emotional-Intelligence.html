        <p>What is Emotional Intelligence? Itâ€™s hard to break down as any one thing but rather a collection of skills that are the sum of how you are with people. People with good emotional intelligence are good listeners, good decision makers for themselves and for groups. EQ also contributes to communication with others so is a big part of how well we get along with others and how we deal with issues others are having.

          IQ represents a person's ability for visual processing, knowledge, reasoning and memory. No doubt these are all important skills that will help a person in a field such as web development become a great developer. However, studies have shown that EQ is more important for success as a great leader in a web development team. Perhaps this is because emotionally intelligent people are better at understanding their own emotions, regulating their emotions and understanding the emotions of others that they are ideal for roles in leadership.

          EQ represents the general way people are able to tackle life. If all web development was, was logging in to a computer and writing some html I think we would find that IQ was by far the only important measure of a good web developer. As we know this isn't the case as Web development is a team sport and EQ is how well we got on in a team.
